24 FEB 2021 : Modification in calculation
Modification or the value Up in the calculation of DGB 
Remplace it by (UA)e = find a way to calculate it
Date of modification 02/03/2021
Resolution : thanks to Quentin LALU it seems that the value should be Up=UA

25 FEB 2021 : Modification calcul Up 
Modification of the value of Up by multiplying R by S the surface of wall on the formula :
Up = 1/Rt is canceled and become Up=1/(Rt*S)
So P=perimeter should be put as a general information input in the file general_informations.txt
And then the calculation will be P*H=S_wall
