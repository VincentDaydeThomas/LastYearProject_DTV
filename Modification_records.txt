03 MAR 2021 : Modification in calculation
Modification or the value Up in the calculation of DGB 
Remplace it by (UA)e = find a way to calculate it
Resolution : thanks to Quentin LALU it seems that the value should be Up=UA

03 MAR 2021 : Modification calcul Up 
Modification of the value of Up by multiplying R by S the surface of wall on the formula :
Up = 1/Rt is canceled and become Up=1/(Rt*S)
So P=perimeter should be put as a general information input in the file general_informations.txt
And then the calculation will be P*H=S_wall


04 MAR 2021 : The influence of the windows
Introducing the windows influence with the superposition principle 
Do another part of the program which calculate :
-The windows phi, f and tau
-The superposition process to obtain f_final, phi_final and tau_final


14 JUNE 2021 : Modification of the program entirely 
Retake the calculation with the ISO13790 added to the ISO 13786;
Multiple Input files (ground, floor, etc...);
Many others minors modifications
The program is completely modified with the use of a function for the calculation,
The program requires now less lines of programmation;
